# Tutorials

These guides are written for application developers who want to use
`electron-effect-rpc` in production Electron apps.

Read them in order if you are new to the package. The first guide gets a full
main/preload/renderer flow working. The second explains failure semantics and
diagnostics. The third covers event streams, lifecycle behavior, and queue
pressure.

- [01 - First RPC: Main + Preload + Renderer](./01-first-rpc.md)
- [02 - Typed Errors, Defects, and Diagnostics](./02-typed-errors-defects-diagnostics.md)
- [03 - Events, Lifecycle, and Backpressure](./03-events-lifecycle-backpressure.md)

If you only need a refresher and not a guided walkthrough, the root
[`README.md`](../../README.md) remains the shortest reference.
